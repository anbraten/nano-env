# Nano web IDE

Develop the web in the web. This project provides a runtime to run Node.js projects completely in the browser by mocking internals like `process`. In addition it includes a shell written in javascript to run commands like `ls` or `cd` and a playground to test those features.

## üöÄ Features

- **Webcontainer compatible api**
  - conforms to the [webcontainer api](https://webcontainers.io/api)

- **Virtual File system**
  - based on [memfs](https://github.com/streamich/memfs)

- **Process management**
  - fork / clone processes
  - pid management
  - `/proc` file system
  - get process exit code
  - node.js compatible [process object](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html)

- **Shell Environment**
  - a shell written in javascript
  - supports: `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, `touch`, `rm`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `pwd`, `env`, `exit`, `true`, `false`, `history`, `clear`, `xdg-open`, `wget`
  - auto-completion for commands, aliases & paths
  - execute commands in `PATH`

- **Networking**
  - service worker to intercept requests

- **Playground**
  - file explorer
  - file editor
  - terminals to run commands
